# personal-portfolio-flask
A Personal Portfolio Using Flask to stage some of the projects
that I've been working on in the summer of 2021

##To get it to work locally:
- Download the project files from my github
- Set up a virtual environment within the project file
- Install the frameworks found in requirements.txt

##After the above steps you can run the project with
- Python3 app.py on a Mac
- Python app.py on a Windows/PC
Afterwards you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and check out 
the website! Cheers!
