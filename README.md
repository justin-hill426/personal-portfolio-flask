# personal-portfolio-flask
A Personal Portfolio Using Flask to stage some of the projects
that I've been working on in the summer of 2021

##To get it to work locally:
- Download the project files from my github
- Set up a virtual environment within the project file
- Install the frameworks found in requirements.txt

##After the above steps you can run the project with
- Python3 app.py on a Mac
- Python app.py on a Windows/PC
Afterwards you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and check out 
the website! Cheers!
  
##What I learned
Coding is so fun! The more you learn to program, the more effective you can be at solving real
problems. This will be the first of many websites that I will be publishing.
I want to continue to learn more and am glad that a Software Engineering track
provides me with so much yet to learn.
